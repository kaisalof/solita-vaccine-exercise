# Solita vaccination exercise 2021

Here is my solution for Solita's vaccination exercise. Exercise was about using THL's vaccine orders and vaccinations data.

I didn't use any database. I just used resources as JSON-files and took data from there.

I used React as a coding language. It is quite new to me and I had lots of challenges with it but I learned alot on the journey. There is still much that I'd like to improve later.
